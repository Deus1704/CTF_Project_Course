## Overview

This project is a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** platform where users can solve various security challenges. Each challenge is a containerized Flask web application that presents a puzzle requiring users to find a secret flag. The system manages these flags, validates submissions, tracks user progress in a database, and provides an admin panel for competition management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Challenge Management**: Dynamic loading of challenges from Docker containers
- **Flag Validation**: Unique flags per user with secure submission handling
- **Leaderboard**: Real-time tracking of user progress and points
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive tools for managing challenges and users
- **Responsive UI**: Clean interface with celebration effects for solved challenges

## Architecture

The platform uses a microservices architecture where:

1. The main Flask application serves the UI and manages user sessions
2. Each challenge runs in its own Docker container with isolated networking
3. A database stores user data, challenge information, and submission history
4. Background processes manage container lifecycle and cleanup
